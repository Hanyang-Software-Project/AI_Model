# README

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed for different stages of a machine learning pipeline. One focuses on sound data preprocessing, and the other implements a supervised learning model using PyTorch.

### Notebooks:
1. **`Sound_Preprocessing.ipynb`**: Preprocesses audio data and extracts useful features for machine learning tasks.
2. **`Pytorch_Supervised_Model.ipynb`**: Implements a supervised learning model using PyTorch for training and evaluation.

## 1. Sound Preprocessing (`Sound_Preprocessing.ipynb`)

### Description

This notebook focuses on preparing audio data for machine learning. It covers steps such as data loading, signal processing, feature extraction, and data augmentation.

### Features

- **Audio Loading**: Import and handle audio files.
- **Signal Processing**: Clean and normalize audio signals.
- **Feature Extraction**: Compute features like:
  - Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
  - Spectrograms
  - Chroma Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations to increase dataset diversity.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `librosa`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Install dependencies using pip if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Load audio files.
   - Preprocess and normalize audio data.
   - Extract features for model training.
4. Modify file paths and feature extraction parameters to suit your dataset.

## 2. PyTorch Supervised Model (`Pytorch_Supervised_Model.ipynb`)

### Description

This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a supervised learning model using PyTorch. It covers model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

### Features

- **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess datasets for training.
- **Model Architecture**: Define a customizable neural network using PyTorch.
- **Training Pipeline**: Steps for:
  - Forward pass
  - Backward pass
  - Loss computation and optimization
- **Evaluation**: Measure performance metrics like accuracy and loss.
- **Visualization**: Plot training curves and evaluation results.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Install dependencies using pip if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Execute the cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Define and train the PyTorch model.
   - Evaluate and visualize the model's performance.
4. Adjust model architecture, hyperparameters, and dataset paths as needed.

## Notes

- Ensure audio files for preprocessing are in compatible formats (e.g., `.wav`).
- Customize the notebooks based on specific project requirements.
- Both notebooks are designed to work together for an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from preprocessing to model training.
